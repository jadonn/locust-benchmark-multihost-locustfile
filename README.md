To use this project, you must download Locust from https://locustio.com.

The test file causes Locust to use a random domain name of the kind 
testdomain####.com where #### is a randomly picked integer from 1 to 3000.

This test file will allow Locust to be used to simulate traffic to multiple hosts 
at the same time.
